# <span style="color:blue"> Frontend Components</span>.

    A collection of useful frontend components for developers by the developers.

 
 ### Usage

1. ```$ npm install ```
    (you can exclude packages you don't require.)

2. Change the path of the ```JS``` file of the component
    you want to use in ```index.html``` file.  

 #### Note:
    I have used parcel module bundler for easy and fast start. You should have it installed globally to run any packages succesfully.
